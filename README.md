# Coding-Rooms
Coding Rooms is a platform where students can collaborate on coding tasks and projects. Users enter a username, join coding rooms, and discuss topics in real-time. Discussions are temporary and disappear after leaving the room. The platform is built using Socket.IO for real-time communication and includes the JSCDN library, Node.js, and Express.js
